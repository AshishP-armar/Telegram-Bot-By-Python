1. Create a Telegram bot
    To use the Telegram API, you will need to create a Telegram bot and obtain its API key. You can do this by talking to the BotFather in Telegram. To do this:

    1. Open the Telegram app on your smartphone or desktop.
    2. Search for the “BotFather” username in the search bar.
    3. Click on the “Start” button to start a conversation with the BotFather.
    4. Type “/newbot” and follow the prompts to create a new bot. The BotFather will give you an API      key that you will use in the next step.
